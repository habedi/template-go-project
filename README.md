This is a template repository with a minimalistic structure to make it easier to start a new Go project,
like for developing a console or a web application.

I made this template to provide a starting point for my Go projects and save time.
It is inspired by the recommendations
in [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).
I hope it will be useful for others as well.
